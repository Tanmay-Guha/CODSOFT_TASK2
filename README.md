# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction

A regression-based machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on metadata such as genre, director, actors, and more.

## 🎯 Objective
Estimate movie ratings using supervised regression algorithms on historical film data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Workflow
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (genre/actor encoding, release year, etc.)
- Model training & comparison
- Evaluation with RMSE and R²

## 💡 Insights
- Directors and actors with consistently good movies strongly influence ratings.
- Certain genres (e.g., documentaries, dramas) receive higher average ratings.

## 📈 Model Performance
- R² Score: XX
- RMSE: XX

## 📊 Dataset
[MovieLens or IMDB-based dataset]
